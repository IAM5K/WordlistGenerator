# WordlistGenerator
## Tool Description:
The Cybersecurity Word Combination Tool is a command-line utility designed to generate word combinations for cybersecurity purposes. It leverages permutation and combination techniques to generate various combinations of provided words or numbers to `.txt` file. This tool is useful in password cracking, security testing, and assessing the strength of passwords.

There will be multiple options for customization :
1. Sequential generation of Number with custom word size.
2. Alpha Numeric Generation.
3. Shoulder Surfing Completion
4. Pattern Completion

Unique Algorithms:
1. Targeted custom list for Red, and Purple Team.
2. Complex character based combinations. Ex : `Iam5k` here `S` ias replaced by 5. Some other varient can be `1am5k`, `14m5k`,`I4M$K`, `I4MSK` and many more.

### Why one should use this over other wordlist out there,
1. If anyone wants to do customisation, you cannot find it over internet as most of the available wordlist are not made in India and maynot have Indian words or names. If you know first word eg: `Vishnu` and there was some combination of special characters and numbers after that. We have a known word limit as `10`. It is very predictable that it can be
   - `Vishnu@123`
   - `Vishnu@xxx` (xxx here can be date of birth, 3 digit of mobile number, Roll number, vechile reg number, or lucky number etc.)
   - `VishnuYxxx` (Y here can be any special character followed by xxx mentioned above)
   - `VishnuXXXX` (4 Digit number from any of above mentioned parameters.)
   This is very obvious that you cannot find this in any pre defined word list.
2. No need to waste your bandwidth and time to download wordlist.
3. Complex password generation.
4. High probablity to crack the target as we are now creating targetted wordlist.
## Usage Guidelines:
1. Installation:
   - Download the tool from the provided source.
   - Install the Go programming language if not already installed.
   - Compile the tool using the appropriate commands.

2. Usage:
   - Run the tool from the command line.
   - Provide multiple words or numbers as input, separated by spaces or commas.
   - The tool will generate all possible combinations based on the provided input.

## Expected Output:
The tool will output a list of word combinations based on the provided input. Each combination represents a permutation of the input words or numbers. The output will be displayed in the command-line interface or written to a text file, depending on the selected options.

## Usage Example:
Command:
```
$ go run main.go --input "word1, word2, word3"
```
Output:
```
Generated combinations:
- word1word2word3
- word1word3word2
- word2word1word3
- word2word3word1
- word3word1word2
- word3word2word1
```

## Tips and Best Practices:
- Choose a diverse set of words or numbers for input to generate a wide range of combinations.
- Experiment with different input sizes to explore the possibilities thoroughly.
- Utilize the output to assess password strength, conduct security testing, or generate wordlists for various cybersecurity purposes.

## Security Considerations:
- Ensure that you have the necessary authorization to use this tool for password cracking or security testing activities.
- Respect privacy and legal boundaries while using the generated word combinations.
- Use the tool responsibly and in alignment with ethical guidelines.

## Limitations and Known Issues:
- Generating word combinations with a large number of input words may result in a substantial number of combinations and significant storage requirements.
- Be mindful of memory usage when working with extensive input sets.
